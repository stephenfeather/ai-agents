constraints:
  hard:
    - statement: Train/test separation
      rationale: Never leak test data into training
    - statement: Reproducibility
      rationale: Set random seeds, pin versions, log parameters
    - statement: No data in git
      rationale: Use DVC or external storage for datasets
    - statement: Validate inputs
      rationale: Check for nulls, dtypes, ranges before modeling
    - statement: Cross-validate
      rationale: Never evaluate on single train/test split for final metrics
    - statement: Appropriate metrics
      rationale: Use task-appropriate evaluation (not just accuracy)
    - statement: Document assumptions
      rationale: Record data assumptions and model limitations
    - statement: Version models
      rationale: Track model versions with MLflow or equivalent
    - statement: No secrets in notebooks
      rationale: Use environment variables for credentials
    - statement: Baseline first
      rationale: Establish baseline before complex models
